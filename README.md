# Scripts associated with the project "A connectivity analysis of forested ecosystems in the St. Lawrence Lowlands of Quebec, Canada"

*BR to update* Descriptions of the methodology are available in [English](https://quebio.ca/en/connectivity_report) and [French](https://quebio.ca/fr/rapport_connectivite).<br />

The top-level folders in this repository are organized in reference to specific phases within the St. Lawrence Lowlands connectivity analysis:<br />
**phase2**: Conservation prioritization of natural habitats in the St. Lawrence Lowlands based on their importance for ecological connectivity<br />
**phase3**: Changing terrestrial habitat connectivity within the St. Lawrence Lowlands under scenarios of climate and landcover change<br />

Subfolders correspond to each natural region (région naturelle) within the St. Lawrence Lowlands ecoregion:<br />
**b01b02**: Plaine du haut Saint-Laurent and Plaine du moyen Saint-Laurent<br />
